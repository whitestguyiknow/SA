-use implementation techniques metnioned in [1] (Points 4&5)
-plot A(y) and x(y) to show taht it is close to linear
-try binomial trees
-mention second order approx works also for log Orenstein Uhlenbeck process, not only GBM
-plot the equation in (15) to show regularity of function which has to be solve
-plot convergence and integrands from HybMMICUB
-check dates of references
-look through introduction of SOB method, state in my introduction earlier work

## 23.Nov
-use Proposition commands and others in latex (like other SA)

##25.Nov
