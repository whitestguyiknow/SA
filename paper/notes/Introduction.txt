#1.Introduction
A standard European basket-spread option is a financial derivative, whose
underlying is a weighted sum of different assets and whose pay-off at
maturity is given by the difference (the so called spread) between two 
baskets of aggregated underlying asset prices. In mathematical terms it's pay-off is given by 
the formula: 
P(S,T) = max(Sum wi*Si(T) - Sum wj*Sj(T) - K, 0)
where Si is the ith underlying asset price, wi the weight and K is the strike price.
Basket-spread options play an important role in hedging a portfolio of correlated long and short
positions in the underlying assets. Especially they are very common in commodity markets,
as producers are exposed to risks arising from spreads between feedstock and end product.
Basket-spread options are traded over-the-counter and on exchanges. Because there is no
closed-form solution for the fair price available it is inescapable to have an accurate and
fast approximation method at hand to price basket-spread options. The multi-dimensionality and
hence the lack of a marginal distribution for the basket-spread makes it impossible to give an exact
analytical representation for the price (even in the simplest and most famous Black-Scholes setting
which states that asset prices are driven by geometric Brownian motions).
