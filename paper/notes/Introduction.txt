#1.Introduction
A standard European basket-spread option is a financial derivative, whose
underlying is a weighted sum of different assets and whose pay-off at
maturity is given by the difference (the so called spread) between two 
baskets of aggregated underlying asset prices. It's pay-off is given by 
following formula: 
P(S,T) = max(Sum wi*Si(T) - Sum wj*Sj(T) - K, 0)
eight and K is it's strike price.
