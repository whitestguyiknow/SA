#2. Second-Order Boundary Method
The second-order boudary method for two-asset spread options (SOB) has been introduced in 2006 by Deng, Li and Zhou [3] and it was extended in 2007 to the multi-asset case [1].
Beside the SOB method Deng, Li and Zhou also introduce the extended Kirk approximation in [1]. Their work is a valuable contribution because numerous methods have been existing 
for spread options involving only two underlyings. in [1] Deng, Li and Zhou compare their two methods with a remarkable work from Carmona and Durrleman (2005) [4] 
which also approximates the multi-asset spread option price. A study* of the results shows that the SOB method is the most accurate and also the fastest. 
The computational edge of the SOB method lies in its closed form which only involves arithmetic calculations.
#2.1 Model Setup
Consider M+N asssets S1(t),S2(t),..., and SM+N(t) whichs price process follows a GBM
dS(t) = u*S(t)dt + sigma*S(t)dW(t).
The payoff of the hybrid European basket-spread at time T is 
max(sum_i=1^M wi*Si(T) - sum_j=M+1^M+N wj*Sj(T) - K,0),
where wi is the weight and K the strike price. We assume that conditioning on the initial asset prices Si(0), log(Si(T)) are jointly normally distributed with mean mu_i, variance v_i^2
and correlation matrix rho_i,j for i,j = 1,2..M+N. As the weights w_i can be incorporated in the asset price by taking Si'=w_i*Si and u_i=log(w_i)+u_i, vi'=vi and rho_i,j'=rho_i,j,
we will assume that all weights wi equal 1 w.l.o.g. Further we assume that the interest rate r is a constant and that the price of the hybrid European basket-spread option is given by
V = exp(-r*T)E^Q[max(sum_i=1^M wi*Si(T) - sum_j=M+1^M+N wj*Sj(T) - K,0)],
where Q is the risk-neutral measure under which discounted security prices are martingales.
